# Project_Prompt
Including the prompts for the virtual device model project.

## architecture_prompt.md
Using this prompt the copilot will generate a framework of the virtual MCU prototype.

## interface_prompt.md
Using this prompt the copilot will generate the adapter layer for the driver code and virtual MCU prototype.

## evaluation_system.md
Using this prompt the copilot will generate a tool for evaluation the generated code.

## evaluation_issue_dma.md
Using this prompt in the issue of the repo, the copilot will evaluation the device code and generate a report for user.

## trace_analysis_prompt.md
Using this prompt the copilot will generate the tool for analyzing the running log and trace to help user to debug the model and driver code.

## Context
You are a professional code quality evaluation engineer. We have two DMA model code implementations that require your expert assessment. Your evaluation scores will be critical in determining which implementation will be integrated into our main codebase.

## Code Locations
The two implementations are located in the following directories:
- **Version 1**: `dmav1/output/`
- **Version 2**: `dmav2/output/`

## Evaluation Scope
Both code implementations provide identical functionality but differ in their implementation approaches. Please carefully review the `README.md` file to understand the background knowledge and evaluation criteria.

## Configuration Parameters
For this evaluation, please use the following parameters as defined in `README.md`:
- `device_name=dma`
- `device_name_v1=dmav1`
- `device_name_v2=dmav2`

## Important Note
**Scope Limitation**: This evaluation request focuses exclusively on **model code assessment**. The implementations do not include driver code components, so please limit your evaluation to the model code only.

## Expected Deliverables
Please provide:
1. **Detailed evaluation report** for each implementation
2. **Comparative analysis** highlighting strengths and weaknesses
3. **Recommendation** on which version should be selected for integration
4. **Specific improvement suggestions** for both implementations

## Evaluation Priority
This assessment is **high priority** as it directly impacts our production codebase selection. Your thorough analysis and professional judgment are essential for making the right technical decision.
